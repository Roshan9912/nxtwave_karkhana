1. Code Structure:
MobiusStrip class with methods to:

Generate the 3D mesh using the parametric equation.

Approximate surface area via cross product of partial derivatives and numerical integration.

Compute edge length by integrating distances along the two edges (v = ±w/2).

Visualize using matplotlib.


2. Surface Area Calculation:
Used cross product of ∂r/∂u and ∂r/∂v to get local surface elements.

Integrated over the u-v domain using the Simpson’s rule for accuracy.


3. Edge Length Calculation:
Calculated two paths along edges (top and bottom boundaries) and summed their lengths.
